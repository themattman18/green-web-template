## Front Matter
At the top of each new note, you must include the triple dashes that make up [Jekyll Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

```
---
---
```

If you forget to add this to a note, it's no big deal! Maxime wrote a plugin called `empty_front_matter_note_injector.rb` which adds these dashes before building the site.

## Note Title
The title of the `.md` file will automatically become the note title heading, rendered as an `<h1>`. Keeping this in mind, start your note content from `<h2>` or `##`.

### Title Override
Use variable `title:` in the front matter to create a note title that is different from the filename.

```
---
title: A note about cats
---
```

In the example above, the filename is `cats.md` but the longer title shows up in the note's heading and `<title>`. See it live at [[cats]].

## Categories
To add a category, add the following to your note front matter:

`category: Cats`

The [[archive]] page automatically displays all notes and their categories (if any). Categories display underneath note title, if they are not null. Eventually I want to make these clickable. Inspired by [Low Tech Mag's Archive Page](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/archives.html).

## Favicon
To override the site favicon on a page level basis, use this variable:

`favicon: 🐈`

Type an emoji directly in your `.md` file and it will replace your favicon for that page only!

## Internal Links
By default, all links created with `<a>` will show up as external links, open in new window, and display a small arrow.

For internal links, add `class="internal-link"` to the HTML.

Unfortunately, `{: .internal-link}` stopped working when I switched to Commonmark.

## Github Flavored Markdown
~~~This site uses [Commonmark Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/github/jekyll-commonmark-ghpages), which replaces the default Kramdown functionality. Read the [Github Markdown Documentation](https://github.github.com/gfm/).~~~

Deleted Commonmark due to some conflicting dependencies. Back to Kramdown now. Will troubleshoot later.

| foo | bar      |
| --- | -------- |
| baz | [[cats]] |

The table above was created with this markup:
`````
| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| baz | [[cats]] |
`````

More info in the [GFM Documentation](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-)

Other options you can add to Commonmark in `_config.yml`:

```sh
Valid options: DEFAULT, VALIDATE_UTF8, SMART, LIBERAL_HTML_TAG, FOOTNOTES, STRIKETHROUGH_DOUBLE_TILDE, SOURCEPOS, HARDBREAKS, SAFE, NOBREAKS, GITHUB_PRE_LANG, TABLE_PREFER_STYLE_ATTRIBUTES, FULL_INFO_STRING
```

Note that an inline code block created with ` `` ` has text wrapping, while preformatted blocks created with ` ``` ` do not.

Description of each option [here](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker#options)

## Typographic Symbols
"Smart" quotes are automatically generated with Commonmark, but the typographic options are documented in [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#typographic-symbols), the built in Jekyll Markdown parser.

-   `---` will become an em-dash (like this —)
-   `--` will become an en-dash (like this –)
-   `...` will become an ellipsis (like this …)
-   `<<` will become a left guillemet (like this «) – an optional following space will become a non-breakable space
-   `>>` will become a right guillemet (like this ») – an optional leading space will become a non-breakable space

## Footnotes
If you create footnotes, you'll need to add a heading for Footnotes at the bottom of your note manually (for now)
