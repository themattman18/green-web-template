## Vault
Open new folder as vault and select the main digital garden folder.

## Settings
`.gitignore` is set to ignore Obsidian system files, so you need to customize the settings from scratch.

### Files & Links
- Set default location for new notes to `_notes`
- Set default location for attachments to `assets/images`
	- Be careful not to select `_site/assets`. Instead, select the folder in your root directory.
- For static pages like `about.md`, drag to `_pages` directory
	- More on this in [[Site Organization]]

Make sure you're working on notes in the `_notes` directory, not `_site`. Unfortunately, you'll just have to put up with all the extra files in your Obsidian view since we can't [ignore Obsidian folders yet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/ignore-a-folder-of-temporary-notes/4473/8).

## Wikilinks
By default, Obsidian uses wikilinks, or double bracketed links. They look `[[like this]]`. If you keep wikilinks enabled, you'll also use proprietary Obsidian wiki embeds for images. They look like this: `![[image.png]]`

This is not standard Markdown! So I wrote an update to the `bidirectional links generator` script that updates this to the proper HTML code. 

Here's a test image to make sure my plugin is working:

## Template Plugin
This is a core Obsidian plugin that is turned off by default.

1. Under Core Plugins, enable "Templates"
2. Select `obsidian-templates` as the template folder
3. Set a hotkey for inserting a template to a file
4. Select note or page templates to insert front matter and variables
